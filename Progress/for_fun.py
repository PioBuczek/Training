# 1. Write a program that accepts a sentence from the user and prints it backwards.

# enter_sentence = input("Enter your sentence: ")
# print(enter_sentence[::-1])

# 2. Create a function that removes all duplicates from the list.

# def delete(lists):
#     new = []
#     for word in lists:
#         if word not in new:
#             new.append(word)
#     return new


# lists = ["my", "yours", "my"]
# result = delete(lists)
# print(result)


# 3.Create a dictionary to represent your shopping list,
# and then write a function that calculates the total price of your purchases.

# def shopping(shopping_list):
#     sum = 0
#     for key in shopping_list.keys():
#         sum += shopping_list[key]
#     return sum


# shopping_list = {"banan": 1.5, "snacks": 2.43}

# result = shopping(shopping_list)
# for key, values in shopping_list.items():
#     print(f"You bought: {key} and pay {values} $.")
# print(f"In total you spent {result} $")
